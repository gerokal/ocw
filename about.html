						<h1>About</h1>
            <br/>
						<p>Gabor Estefan is a certificated coach and teacher who helps millennials to become creative professionals and finally get money for what they love doing.</p>
            <p>After having enough from the soul sucking jobs and arrogant managers he decided to make his way out of the rut and take control of his life and create his own dream life style and career. Since the wake up call his mission is to become someone who can easily break through limitations and by using his talent and creativity he wants to help others to experience the freedom of choice in their life.</p>
            <p>He studied day and night to find out how to get where he wanted to be, he collected all the knowledge and organised into a programme that he wants to share with you.</p>
            <p>Gabor doesn’t believe in quick fixes, shortcuts and easy success. It is not just about you need to be happy and then your life will be beautiful. He knows that if you want to achieve something earlier, you need a crystal-clear vision, focus, determination and you need to work very hard.</p>
            <p>He knows it is not easy so instead of traditional coaching he provides unique and fun experiences that can make the process more enjoyable.</p>
            <p>His solutions to your problems are fresh, simple and easy to apply them into your everyday life so you can save time and energy and focus on what is really important for you.</p>
            <p>He knows everyone is different and we all need different strategies to get the results we want.</p>

            <p class="bold-text">Do you want to work and improve yourself with someone who is friendly, open to your problems and really understands your struggle and can help to decrease your frustration?</p>
            <p>Just come along and have a coffee or tea with me and let’s talk about your dreams and struggles. You can find me on these locations after booking <span style="font-weight:bold;">YOUR FIRST 45-MINUTE SESSION.</span></p>

            <p style="font-weight:bold;">OK, but how much is that?</p>
            <p>The prices of coaching in London can be very high, but when was the last time you really take care of yourself? We usually end up by giving too much to others and pleasing everyone around us. Do you think it is time to reward yourself and give yourself what you have been deserved? Which is a better life. And the secret is, the more you give to yourself, the more you will be able to give to your loved ones, because the positive changes you make into your life will affect the life of the people you meet every day. What I will give you is better health, wealth and happiness that worth every penny. I promise, I will charge you for the average price of coaching and your money will be worth spent.</p>
            <p>For your money you will get 6 times 45-minute coaching sessions plus the first session is complimentary. We will meet once a week between 17:30 and 19:00 on your preferred location you can choose above. You will get my full support and I will provide you a workbook, note book and a pen also for free.</p>
